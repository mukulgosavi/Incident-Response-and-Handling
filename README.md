Incident Handling Scenario We will investigate a cyber attack in which the attacker defaced an organization's website. This organization has Splunk as a SIEM solution setup. Our task as a Security Analysis would be to investigate this cyber attack and map the attacker's activities into all 7 of the Cyber Kill Chain Phases:

Reconnaissance Phase  
Exploitation Phase  
Installation Phase  
Action on Objective  
Command and Control Phase  
Weaponization Phase  
Delivery Phase 


**The Incident Handling Life Cycle: **
