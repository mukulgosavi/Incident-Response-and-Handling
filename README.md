Incident Handling Scenario We will investigate a cyber attack in which the attacker defaced an organization's website. This organization has Splunk as a SIEM solution setup. Our task as a Security Analysis would be to investigate this cyber attack and map the attacker's activities into all 7 of the Cyber Kill Chain Phases: 
1. Reconnaissance  
2. Weaponization  
3. Delivery  
4. Exploitation  
5. Installation  
6. Command and Control  
7. Actions on Objectives  


**The Incident Handling Life Cycle**:  
1. Preparation  
2. Detection and Analysis  
3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery  
4. Post-Incident Activity/Lessons Learnt
